Execute Maya is a tiny utility for automating various Autodesk Maya activities. Consider you have lot of maya files, that are to be processed with some MEL script. How do you do that? Will you open each file one by one and run the script? Here is another situation... You want to remove all unused nodes and do various optimization for 100s of maya files before rendering. Again you will be forced to do one by one.
So to rescue from these kind of situation, you may use xecute maya.

How to use:
1. Configure the XM properly. (Settings tab)
2. Drag/Drop maya files (mb/ma) into the application
3. Double click the maya MEL script file available in Toolbox. (This will be loaded in MEL script editor for further editing)
4. Click "RUN"!

You are done! You can drag/drop any number of maya files. Each file will be processed with the MEL script provided. At the same time... You may see the live log while each file is in progress.
